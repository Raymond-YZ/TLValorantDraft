This project is an emulation of what a website could look like using the Bulma framework. 
It is a website showing off one of the best European VALORANT teams of 2020, Team Liquid.
It was created during Liquid Hacks, Team Liquid's first ever hackathon.
This site was created mostly through HTML (w/Bulma) with 100% of the site originally created by me (pictures credited to their respective owners).
Another draft involving CSS and React is not included here as it is shared with other contributors who wish to keep it private.
